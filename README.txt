Cloney
======

Cloney is a Windows application that lets you clone .NET
solutions with a few clicks. 

Cloney copies files and folders from your old solution. 
It replaces the old namespace everywhere and ignores some 
files and folders (like git and svn), leaving you with a new, 
clean solution without a trace of the old stuff.

To use Cloney, just select a source folder that contains
the original solution, a target folder to which it is to
be cloned, then click a button and you're done.

Cloney is currently being developed and fine-tuned a bit,
but will soon be available for download.
